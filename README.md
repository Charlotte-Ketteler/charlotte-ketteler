# Hi there!

I'm Charlotte and I was born in Cologne on 27th August 1991. As my father is an Englishman, myself and my brother grew up bulingual. Though I grew up in Germany one part of me will always be english. I now live in DÃ¼sseldorf with my husband an 2 year old daughter. 

I love horses and one of my dreams is to go on vacation in the Rocky Mountains, go trail riding and do some spins on a quarter horse. I spend some time on spotify, scrolling around to find so new songs in different genres. 

Now my 2 year long parental leave is over I'm really excited to start a career in Web Development. My goals are beeing successful and developing great webpages that inspire and creating an app that entertains you or helps you in your day-to-day life.
